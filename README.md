# My-Library
The items listed here  are to prepare  us well  towards being a good Computer Science scholar.These are also a reference for interview preparation. 

# Data Science
### Pre Requisite :
Mathematics is the core of datascience and since most of the problems in this domain are arcane .So, a better understanding of mathematical concepts in and out are required for research purpose.
